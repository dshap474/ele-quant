**CHAPTER 1 The Map and the Territory**

**The Questions**
1.  What are the essential components of quantitative investing?
2.  What types of securities are involved and how are they traded?
3.  Who are the main market participants and what roles do they play?
4.  Where do excess returns in investing come from?
5.  What are the key elements that form the analytical framework of a quantitative portfolio manager?

This chapter is a guide to the essential components of quantitative investing. When considering the meaning of a word, it’s often instructive to go back to its etymology. So let’s play this game. Despite being a Germanic language, English adopted many words from Latin, sometimes by way of French. “Investing” comes from “investire,” which in Latin meant “to vest with a robe, to clothe, to surround.” This meaning is still used in English, as in “the investiture of a new pope.” It is also the favorite garment of hedge fund managers. In the Middle Ages, the verb took on the additional meaning of “to surround, to take ownership of.” It is also possible that the modern meaning overtook the old because, in ceremonies in which someone was given possession of an office, they were often given a robe or other symbolic item. “Investire” is the direct successor to Latin—the old meaning is gone, and “investire” only means “to receive possession of something.” As for “quantitative,” that is Latin too. “Quantum” means denoting something that can be measured, increased or decreased. So, we deal with measurements, sums, and budgets. Quantitative investing can be measured, increased and decreased. This is the map, while the territory is the world of finance. You can own a house, a painting, a bet on the survival of humankind, or even an idea. Each one of these investment topics deserves its own book, written by a competent author. In writing this book, I have chosen to trade off generality in favor of depth. I have confined myself to the goal of this book: that you should be sufficiently equipped to understand, to implement, and to critique. However, even an analytical book needs an introduction that puts things in their proper context. In this chapter, I aim to provide that context. You will have a broad understanding of the classes of securities to which these methods apply, and of the way they are traded. We will also look at the market participants, and the roles they play. We will also explore fundamental questions: Where are excess returns coming from? What causes these trading opportunities? Finally, I will present the essential components that make up the analytical framework of a quantitative portfolio manager. The underlying message is that to be successful, an investor must understand how things work. A seminal early book on investing is titled, *The Intelligent Investor* (Graham, 2003). To double down on Latin, the original meaning of “intelligent” is “to read into something,” similar to “insightful” in the English language. Your success as a quantitative investor will depend on your ability to read into the data, governing the trading of your assets, and the functioning of exchanges. Many budding quants focus on quantitative methods. The fact is that theory is cheap and is often not hard. What is hard is putting the right tool at the service of the right insight.

Finally, this is the only chapter without mathematics. You should enjoy it while it lasts.

**1.1 The Securities**

We will be concerned with standardized products that are liquid. We explain these concepts in more detail.

To “own” an object is effectively to own a claim on that object. In the future, if you have a house, you don’t own it outright. You own a claim on it. This claim is not absolute, however. In most countries, the local or central government may need your property for reasons of public welfare and can require you to exchange your claim for cash at a fair price. If you own a painting, you may enjoy it in the comfort of your home, but you may not be able to sell it easily. The claim is not standardized, and the market for paintings is illiquid. We will be concerned with point claims that prevent it from paying (e.g., consider a zombie apocalypse scenario). Defining ownership of an “idea” is especially challenging and prone to be treated on an ad-hoc basis. Compared to the infinite and ever-changing universe of possible claims, financial markets deal with a very small subset of these claims: the subset of claims that are standardized and liquid. We buy and sell standardized claims. These claims come in a few varieties, and their attributes are clearly defined and known to all potential buyers and sellers. Examples are:

*   Equities and Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs). These give us partial ownership in companies, or groups of companies, and entitle us to future cash payments generated by the economic activities of these companies.
*   Futures. These contracts deliver a physical commodity or a cash payment contingent on the state of the world at a future date, at a price determined today.
*   Bonds. These are contracts that allow the transfer of debt claims among parties. An investor lends money to a borrower in exchange for a fixed cash flow in the future (e.g., periodic interest payments and a final payment). A bond makes this claim transferable to other lenders.
*   Options. These are claims that depend on the future value of some underlying asset. For example, you may secure the right (but not the obligation) to buy a stock at a future date, at a price determined today. The nature of these claims is standardized, hence the term “vanilla.”
*   Interest Rate Swaps (IRSs). These contracts allow the exchange of a certain, deterministic cash flow stream for an uncertain one, which depends on interest rates at future dates.
*   Credit Default Swaps (CDSs). These contracts insure the buyer against the default of a company’s debt. The buyer pays a periodic premium to the seller in exchange for receiving the par value of the debt if the company defaults.

These further contracts are liquid. For our purposes, a liquid contract is one that can be bought and sold in large enough sizes, and at sufficiently short time horizons, to enable quantitative strategies to be implemented. This means that if we plan to buy or sell a contract, we should be able to do so without incurring a large cost, and that the price at which we transact should not be too different for small trading sizes, and that the waiting time due to searching for a counterparty should not be so long as to make the transaction economically unattractive.

The properties of standardization and liquidity are closely intertwined. Increased standardization tends to enhance liquidity by consolidating demand, as it aggregates dispersed demand from bespoke products toward a smaller set of standardized ones. Increased standardization also streamlines the trading process, which reduces search costs and settlement complexity. Both of these effects reduce risk and thus attract more participants, thus enhancing liquidity. However, the downside is that customers may sacrifice the ability to trade custom useful product characteristics. Determining the optimal level of customization, even at the expense of some liquidity, is an ongoing process that depends on industry circumstances, refer to the 2008 financial crisis (Acharya, Cooley, Richardson, Van Nieuwerburgh, and White, 2010). For example, the CDS market evolved rapidly. However, the “Big Bang” initiated by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) on April 8, 2009, simplified contract terms, including standardizing coupon rates (100 bps and 500 bps) and introducing a standard upfront payment, played a pivotal role in restoring confidence in this asset class (Nosal, 2010).

Trading and liquidity are at the core of the book. In order to better understand the trading process and the nature of liquidity, we should describe in some detail how trading on exchange and over-the-counter happens.

**1.2 Modes of Exchange**

At any given time, economic agents want to buy or sell contracts. They want to do so quickly, cheaply, and reliably. The most optimal setup which leads to this currently organized are exchanges, over-the-counter, and dark pools. Exchanges are venues in which the orders of buyers and sellers are anonymized and matched against each other. Orders are characterized by size, the number of contracts, direction (buy or sell), and price. An exchange requires that its members respect its contracts. The exchange usually sets strict rules and a high bar as to the limit order book (LOB), and employs a set of priority rules to match buy and sell orders in the exchanges—aptly named a matching engine. In order to trade on an exchange, one must be a member of that exchange. Membership entails apparent costs (fees) and non-apparent costs (compliance). Multiple participants must maintain sound governance, risk processes, and capital structure.

Exchanges evolve continuously due to two driving forces. On one side, there is a push toward consolidation, which reduces operating costs and gives the owner pricing power. On the other side, technical and process innovations introduce new competitors into the market. In the United States alone, there are more than a dozen equity stock exchanges. Nowadays, most exchanges are electronic, but some (Knez and Ready, 1996), including futures exchanges, are still open outcry, although this condition is neither necessary nor sufficient: some exchange-traded assets are traded in minimal volumes and, therefore, are not liquid, and some very liquid products are traded off-exchange.

Other assets are not traded on exchanges, but over-the-counter (OTC). In this case, the buyer or seller transacts through an institutional market participant, the broker-dealer, or directly with each other. This applies to a broad range of assets, such as loans, bonds, IRSs, Forex and commodities, structured products, and CDSs, examples of contracts traded OTC. Some of these, like currencies, are among the world’s most liquid contracts. A precondition for liquidity is standardization. Think of a house. The New York housing market is very different from the stock market or the bond market. Houses are not standardized. Each of them is unique and distinguishable from the other and sells in a matter of seconds. In contrast, a house has many attributes that make it unique: location, size, age, blueprint, and condition. Another characteristic of liquid markets is the large number of participants. When the number of counterparties becomes too small, competition for a security wanes, while the number of counterparties becomes too large, and eventually the bilateral bargaining diminishes. The ability of any individual participant to influence the price is significantly reduced. To illustrate, consider the housing market as a counterpoint: when selling a house, you typically negotiate with one specific buyer or seller. The negotiation process may take several days or weeks. You may list the property and may engage in intense bargaining, sometimes to the point of contention, to secure the best possible price.

Finally, Dark Pools (a type of ATS, or Alternative Trading System, which does not make its LOB transparent) are additional venues that are distinct from exchanges and OTC markets where trades happen. Dark Pools allow large buyers and sellers, institutional investors to trade orders without displaying their trading intentions. By design, Dark Pools hide order details and only make trades details available after execution. As of 2014, approximately 15% of U.S. shares are traded on Dark Pools.

**1.3 Who Are the Market Participants?**

It is convenient to partition traders into the sell side and the buy side. The former is in the business of providing services; the latter executes trades for their own benefit. Below I describe the participant types. For a more detailed description, see Harris (2003).

**1.3.1 The Sell Side**

The sell side comprises brokers, dealers, and broker-dealers.

*   Dealers. These are market participants that provide liquidity, meaning they make the market for the assets they trade. They are profitable if they can buy (bid) at a price lower (higher) than what they usually paid to buy (sell) the asset. The difference between buy and sell prices is the spread. When dealers interact with clients, they quote the buy price (the bid) and the sell price (the ask). The dealer’s goal is to make transactions possible. In OTC markets, dealers are the primary liquidity providers. The most sophisticated among such markets allow the dealers to quote prices, quantities, and other attributes continuously, for example, via electronic trading platforms such as Tradeweb or Bloomberg. In order to make markets in the highly bespoke products, the dealers quote on request, possibly one-sided quotes for a specific quantity and with an expiration time. The quote, or the spread if the quote is two-sided, depends on the dealer’s inventory, the dealer’s risk appetite, and the dealer’s view on the market. Dealers can also take speculative positions, meaning they hold a portfolio (or an inventory of positions) and face the issue of trading counterparties that may be more informed than themselves. Unlike speculators, dealers are passive traders, in that they respond to orders. Dealers are subject to intense scrutiny from financial regulatory bodies. Retail dealers often choose their own execution venues for their clients; they are informed agents, often serving the needs of the client. The dealer’s profit originates from the realized spread. The inside spread (which is usually lower than the quoted spread) is also the source of the dealer’s profit. The dealer’s profit also comes from the order flow. One specific type of flow originates from retail investors (who we introduce later in this chapter). These investors access the market indirectly through brokers. Brokers have special arrangements with dealers to route their clients’ orders to them. In summary, dealers are liquidity providers, and they are compensated for services through trading profits.
*   Brokers, trade on behalf of their clients. When the broker receives an order from a client, together with information about the client’s needs, the broker will try to find a counterparty to execute the order in accordance with these preferences. For example, a client sends a broker an order to buy a certain number of shares of a company. The broker is a member of all major exchanges. It submits the order to one or more exchanges and ensures that the transaction is settled. The broker may also execute the order with one of its own clients or its expected cost. Dealers, brokers are intermediaries who take no risk by holding contract positions at any given time. The intermediation service they provide is beneficial, however. It comes with a cost. The broker charges a commission for its services. Non-member clients and firms provide OTC dealer access to non-institutional clients. Institutional clients, too, may want to enlist a broker when interacting with dealers, since the broker anonymizes the clients. Further, brokers provide several other useful settlement, clearing, and technological products often free of charge. Clients need to know and trust their counterparty to protect themselves from insolvency, reneging, or non-compliance. There is a small number of brokers compared to the number of traders, so that a client has to be opaque and use the broker to buy or sell securities. Anonymity is important in this case, and this is its use. This use does not eliminate counterparty risk. It transfers it to the brokers. The brokers manage it by vetting the clients, and by requiring that clients deposit capital at the broker, which the broker uses in case of default. The amount of capital depends on the riskiness of the client. In addition to these services, brokers, and especially prime brokers, the solicitation of brokers servicing hedge funds and other sophisticated investors, offer their clients other services. Common services brokers ensure include receipt, recording, and safekeeping of financial assets.
    Rehypothecation. Clients may allow the brokers to use their securities for the brokers’ own needs in exchange for fees or rebates. For example, brokers may use client securities as collateral to borrow cash from other institutions. In turn, brokers lend clients securities from their own inventory or from other clients.
    Margin loans. Brokers lend clients short-term capital to buy securities. They charge them SOFR[2] plus a spread.
    Lending of short positions. Clients may want to short stocks (i.e., sell stocks they do not own). Brokers will source the stock with the expectation that future prices will be lower than current ones. Brokers enable these transactions by lending shares from a third party and making them available to clients. The clients then sell them in the open market, buy them back at a later time, and return them to the broker. After the initial sale, but before the buyback, the broker receives the proceeds from the sale as collateral. The broker receives from the broker SOFR minus a spread.
    Research reports and services, as well as broker-specific data. These services used to be bundled in broker commissions but are now unbundled as a result of MiFID II regulation; they are now charged separately.
    Capital introductions, in which brokers facilitate the connection between hedge funds and potential investors.
    In summary, brokers offer diversified services, the most important of which are execution, clearing, settlement, custody, financing, and communication, interest on cash balances, research on trading, and payment for order flow (PFOF), which is the compensation brokers receive from market makers for routing orders to them.
*   Broker-dealers, also called dual traders, combine the previous two functions in a single entity. They act on both behalf of the client and on their own behalf. This introduces a tension. As dealers (a term we use to refer to the dealer function of a broker-dealer), they make markets. Maybe the simplest action is front-running: the dealer is aware of incoming buying or selling demand for a security, and buys it in advance before this demand manifests in the market and is reflected in prices. To mitigate this conflict of interest, regulations are in place that require broker-dealers to separate their client-facing and proprietary trading desks, and broker-dealers is the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (or “1934 Act”).

**1.3.2 The Buy Side**

The buy side usually trades with the sell side. You (the reader of this book) are likely to be on the buy side, even if you entertain the notion of becoming a sell-side dealer. The buy side is more diverse than the sell side. The main goal of the buy-side drama are, because you will continuously interact with them, and your excess returns will be the outcome of this interaction. We could classify the buy side actors according to several criteria. For example, the sub-industry to which they belong (e.g., insurance vs. hedge funds), but I opt not to classify them purely based on the type of institution.

*   Passive institutional investors. These portfolios replicate the composition of the benchmark, or rather, generated by data providers like MSCI, S&P, Russell, CRSP, or from exchanges like FTSE 100, TOPIX, and Deutsche Borse. These indices are updated on a quarterly or biannual basis, and they comprise broad indices as well, like the Bloomberg Agg (until 2016 owned by Barclays). Sectoral indices (e.g., financials or technology), or style indices (e.g., value or small cap). Large firms in this group are Blackrock, Vanguard, and State Street. Indexers make up a large and growing share of the total asset base. According to estimates by Charles Schwab, passive investing now represent over 50% of the U.S. stock market capitalization as of 2019.
*   Hedgers are firms participating in markets with the primary objective of reducing financial risk originating from their core business activities. For example, currency risk is faced by any firm doing business internationally. Commodity price risk is faced by firms using or producing commodities (e.g., airlines purchase fuels; oil, gas, firms, and miners). Interest rate risk is faced by firms whose price variability can be very disruptive. Hedgers primarily participate in derivative markets: futures, swaps, and options. Hedge funds differ from other participants who also hedge, such as dealers or hedgers. In fact, that hedging is the primary activity they perform.
*   Institutional active managers are firms investing on behalf of their clients. They run strategies that are sometimes benchmarked to common market indices. Examples are mutual funds, sovereign wealth funds, insurance or pension funds, endowments, and family offices. See SPIVA reports, or the Refinitiv study (Chow, 2021). Both show that over 60% of funds underperform their benchmarks over a one-year trading basis. The subperformance of funds over one year is not surprising. What is surprising is that the majority of funds underperform the S&P500 over the previous 15 years. On the other side, funds serving institutions seem to beat their benchmarks (Pástor and Linnaimaa, 2021). The term used for the process is mean reversion. Otherwise, active managers would not be in business. The risk they take is compensated by the return they generate. Active managers are often constrained by a benchmark, and discretionary positions of a “tracking portfolio.” A large tracking error gives the funds much discretion; a low one places their returns close to the indices, and makes them resemble index funds. Active managers also differ in the degree of discretion they manage portfolios. Some portfolios are restricted to a single asset class. Within an asset class, the portfolio closely follows a representative benchmark. One can view asset allocation as messages that communicate to clients the desired relative weight of each asset class in the portfolio. Asset classes are broadly defined. Commonly asset classes are equities, bonds, commodities, and cash equivalents; in addition, asset classes invest in alternative asset managers like private equity firms, venture capital, hedge funds, and real estate.
*   Informed traders include primarily hedge funds and principal trading firms. These firms are usually organized as partnerships, although a minority of them are publicly traded. They are active investors. They manage money for themselves and for their clients. Principal trading firms only have general partners (GPs, the principals) investing their own money; hedge funds also have limited partners (LPs) who do not invest actively.[3] These firms aim to generate returns that are not correlated with traditional asset classes.[4] They exhibit low correlation to the returns of major classes.[5] Informed traders invest heavily in human capital, technology, and data to achieve this goal. They fulfill two major functions. The first one is price discovery. By using all information available to them, they form an estimate of the true value of a security. If the security prices differ from their estimates, they trade to exploit the mispricing. If the price is lower than their estimate, they buy the security. In the process, they increase its price and bring it closer to equilibrium. Mispricing can take many forms. If the mispricing is a result of temporary liquidity dry-ups, then the actions of this large subset of informed traders will try to exploit the difference; of course, this may not be easy to do as the difference either persists, or disappears very quickly due to technology investment in low-latency trading. The second function is risk transfer. If a security is mispriced, then, instead of arbitrage, certain is applicable to a certain degree. I provide examples in Section 1.4. Hedge funds and market makers develop specialized strategies that predict imbalances. Hold (or short) securities because liquidity need materializes. These strategies are often based on statistical arbitrage. The subtle interplay between prediction and event can be vast—from sub-second for high-frequency market makers to weeks or months for hedge funds.
*   Retail investors trade for their own account via retail brokers. In most countries, retail investors make up a small fraction of total volume; the share was slightly higher than 10% in 2011. Several studies, across different national markets and periods, have shown that retail traders are consistently unprofitable (Barber and Odean, 2013); retail traders lose money, on average. The main reason is that they trade too often, after the dealers, who will pay the retail brokers for routing it to them (payment for order-flow).

**1.4 Where Do Excess Returns Come From?**

Now that we have introduced the main actors in the play, a usually unasked, rarely answered, and occasionally a source of meaning, we can discuss the sources of excess returns. The “excess” qualifier means “in excess of portfolio invested in risk-free assets, such as short-dated U.S. treasuries.” This topic is central both to academic financial research and to practitioners. Academic finance is primarily concerned with the question of efficiency in the words of Malkiel (1987).

A capital market is said to be efficient if it fully and correctly reflects all available information in determining security prices. Formally, the market is said to be efficient with respect to some information set $\mathcal{I}$ if security prices would be unaffected by revealing that information to all participants. Note that the definition of market efficiency based on information set $\mathcal{I}$ implies that it is impossible to make economic profits by trading on the basis of information set $\mathcal{I}$.

An exceptionally concise definition, if there ever was one. As is now in the Fama-French tradition, we can distinguish three forms of market efficiency, depending on the information set. This could be, for example, the set of all historical prices of the traded securities. Moreover, this information can be obtained with relatively little effort. A different set of information set is publicly available information, defined in the United States as “any representation or statement, including general news or industry reports, (1) made by or on behalf of an issuer of securities, (2) contained in any reports, proxy statements, registration statements, or other documents filed with Federal, state, or local governmental agencies or self-regulatory organizations, or (3) contained in any widely disseminated media (e.g., public disclosures to the general public that are required to be made by federal, state, or local law).” An even finer information set is the set of all information available to any investor. Academic research tries to assess the validity of the efficient market hypothesis (EMH) by testing whether it is possible to predict future prices. Indeed, there is empirical evidence that asset prices are predictable. However, the hypothesis is that current prices may not be affected. We do not trade in the direction of returns, up to the point that the investing horizon is very long. The reason is that the signal-to-noise ratio of the prediction is too low. One reason is that the uncertainty around the prediction is too high for us to take advantage of it. For example, say that, to the best of our knowledge, the expected return of the S&P500 is 6% per year, with a standard deviation of 20%. Even if we are confident that our estimate of the expected return is correct, the standard deviation of market returns is 20%, a little too high for comfort. Risk, however, is not the only reason. Another one is liquidity. Indeed, the road to hell is paved with good intentions. There are many examples of assets that are predictable but not easy to trade. A famous example is the Palm-Pilot (later Palm, a now defunct mobile device company) vs 3Com (a telecom equipment maker, also defunct) in 2000. 3Com floated on the public market 5% of the shares of Palm, while retaining the other 95%. Right after the initial public offering (IPO), Palm had a market value of $53B, while 3Com had a market capitalization of $28B. The implied value of 3Com assets was -$25B, even though the company had no debt. This is an example of pure arbitrage. An investor could have shorted Palm shares and bought 3Com shares and pocketed $25B. However, the investor could not therefore bought 3Com shares and shorted Palm for an equal amount. The portfolio comprising these two assets was a synthetic asset whose return could be predicted. There was a problem, however: the shares of Palm were short-sale constrained. This means that there was a limited supply of Palm shares available to be shorted. The cost of borrowing Palm shares was very high, so high as to make the trade either unattractive or impossible.

Risk and liquidity are not the only two factors limiting the exploitation of information. We list three more. The first one is funding. Consider a scenario in which certain assets, or certain portfolios, have lost much of their value due to market distress. We are managing a small hedge fund, which has also lost money in this market. The fund’s investors are redeeming their capital. We are forced to liquidate our positions. Such scenarios, also called “fire sales,” are common. This is often called “unwinding spirals.” However, we do not have much capital available to post as margin. In addition, we need a capital buffer in order to withstand a possible additional loss in the very short term. Funding constraints prevent us from buying the asset, in spite of our accurate forecast.

A significant source of excess returns comes from flow predictability. Some agents, such as index funds, mutual funds, and retail investors, trade in a way that is not based on known securities on dates. Speculators can then take advantage of this information by providing liquidity beforehand. One of the most important instances of this is index rebalancing. Several index providers update the weights of the stocks in their indices on a regular basis, usually quarterly or semiannually. The additions to the index are made public, and the new weights are effective on a given date, often with an updated weight. The term used for this process is index rebalancing. For example, TSLA was added to the NASDAQ 100, effective July 15, 2013. The announcement was made on July 10, 2013, but several investors could have foreseen this event. The price of TSLA shares increased by 10% between July 10 and July 15. The demand for TSLA shares and therefore the change of index have an obligation to buy TSLA is the close of that day, and the resulting demand is likely to push up the stock price. Informed investors anticipating this may do so by buying the stock beforehand. The information that drives these predictable flows is not related to the company’s fundamentals but rather from company-specific or industry-specific issues. These, however, is the remote that that the reconstitution be cancelled or postponed. The size of passive investing is large and to estimate ranges from 5% (Frazzini, 2013) to 38% (Chavez and Samadi, 2016). The cost of such trades is large, and it is borne by the passive investors. The total cost of such predictable flows is in the order of $1B-$2B per year. A prominent example of predictable flows, but several others exist, usually smaller in size, but also not as widely known as index rebalancings. Their common feature is the existence of institutional or procedural constraints (sometimes driven by internal processes, other times by regulatory requirements) that introduce predictability in the demand of securities.

Finally, we consider a last source of excess returns: informational advantage. This means that the investors not only differ by their risk attitude, their tolerance to illiquidity, or their funding constraints, but also by the quality of their information. Some investors have better, more accurate forecasts of future prices or returns. This is what is often meant by “statistical arbitrage:” the ability to predict returns accurately based on insights our competitors do not have.

In summary, even assuming accurate information owned by participants, some of them cannot exploit this information. We have listed several possible causes of return predictability:

*   pure arbitrage;
*   heterogeneous risk preferences;
*   liquidity;
*   funding;
*   flow predictability;
*   informational advantages.

These causes are not exhaustive. For example, flow predictability and liquidity are related, albeit not identical, and the distinction between being compensated for risk-taking and holding an actual information advantage is usually unclear. However, these broad classes can help us reason about one strategy’s edge.

**1.5 The Elements of Quantitative Investing**

The investment process is usually viewed as a highly structured process. There are several ways to represent it; the development of which is the responsibility of remote teams. In Figure 1.1 I show a possible organization of these components, which I follow in the organization of the book. I review them below.

[Image: Figure 1.1: The components of the investment process.]
(Diagram shows: Data -> Before the Trade (Prices, Risk, Expected Returns, Signal Aggregation, Constraints, Optimization) -> During the Trade (Execution, Hedging, Leverage) -> After the Trade (Profit and Loss, Performance Attribution, Risk Control, Intertemporal Volatility Allocation). Data also feeds into Characterization and Time Series.)

**Data**. The essential inputs to investing are under the “Data” section to the extreme left.
Prices and trading volumes are often collected at regular intervals (e.g., every minute, every 5, 10, 15 minutes, or daily). For high-frequency strategies it may be necessary to use order-level exchange data.
Characteristics are numerical scalars associated with a security and a timestamp. Common examples are descriptions of the security, like the free cash flow generated by the firm in the most recent quarter, divided by the market capitalization of the stock. Or the stock’s beta, calculated using daily returns over the last six months.
Time series are often derived from characteristics (which are multivariate time series). Examples are time series of the Consumer Price Index (CPI), which can be used to estimate the inflation rate in the United States. Yield of the 10-year U.S. Treasury bond, the VIX index, the effective federal funds rate, the overnight rate for unsecured lending of reserves among commercial banks, and the VIX, a forward-looking measure of U.S. equities market volatility.
Unstructured data are the dark matter of financial data. Prices, characteristics, and time series are structured data: numerical, categorical, or ordinal (i.e., rankings), and in tabular form. Unstructured data are usually character sequences representing natural language (e.g., earnings transcripts and firm news) or images (e.g., satellite images), video/audio recordings, or network data (e.g., social media data). Often, unstructured data is used to develop the above formats).

**Before the trade**. Data are used to develop three components that enter the portfolio construction during the trade. Because they precede the trading process, I classify their development as being “Before the trade.”
Risk. The word “risk” can mean many things. In the context of this book, we will use portfolio volatility as a proxy for risk. Estimating this volatility for an arbitrary portfolio is a challenging task.
Expected returns. In order to be profitable, a trading strategy needs to have information predictive of future returns. This is often viewed as the paramount concern of a quantitative investor and to a large extent it is. Many modern trading strategies focus on predicting returns over short horizons of minutes or hours. The number of estimates can run into the thousands of millions.
Transaction costs and market impact. Trading securities is expensive. Transaction costs can be explicit (e.g., commissions) or implicit (e.g., the bid-ask spread). Market impact is the adverse price movement caused by our trading. Among other things, transaction costs and market impact determine whether a predicted return at some horizon can be turned into a profitable strategy or not, and what is the maximum profit that can be extracted from such a strategy.
During the trade. The portfolio construction procedure happens “During the trade,” because the portfolio construction procedure results in real-time trading decisions, and these decisions determine the Profit and Loss (P&L) of the strategy. The decisions taken in this part form the core of portfolio construction.
Incorporation of risk constraints. A strategy’s P&L is a function of the maximum risk that it can take. This is usually represented in the portfolio construction problem either in the form of constraints (e.g., the portfolio volatility must be less than a given value) or as a term in the objective function. Risk constraints and sensitivities can have a very material impact on the performance of the strategy.
Signal aggregation. We use the term signal for a model of expected returns. For a given asset, we can have many signals. For example, we can have a signal based on momentum and a signal based on value. In practice, combining such signals into a single signal.
Hedging decision. Certain trading strategies have exposure to systematic risk. In layman’s terms, they can lose money because their returns are correlated to market-wide sources of risk. Some of these sources can be hedged, which means that such risk can be counterbalanced. This is an important consideration that can make or break a strategy.

**After the trade**. The trading process generates a time series of P&L, both for the overall portfolio and for its constituents.
Performance attribution. In the portfolio construction phase we estimate the expected P&L of the portfolio. Performance attribution is the practice of tracing back performance to its possible sources, to see what worked and what did not, so that we can learn from the experience. Moreover, performance attribution is essential for communicating with investors.
Risk control. Risk control is the set of procedures employed to assess whether we have shift in sizing our bets.
Intertemporal volatility allocation and leverage. How should we allocate risk across periods? This decision is very consequential. For example, should we increase or decrease our leverage in response to changes in the market environment? This is one of the core questions of the Capital Asset Management Model (CAM) of the portfolio and Assets Under Management (AUM).

I stress that different arrangements are possible, for example, Narang (2014) employs a simpler scheme, and Pedersen (2015) has yet another one. Some of the individual elements I introduce are present in their models of quantitative investing.

**The Takeaways**

*   Market participants can be broadly classified into sell-side and buy-side participants. The sell-side participants are:
    *   Dealers
    *   Brokers
    *   Broker-dealers
    The buy-side participants are:
    *   Passive institutional investors
    *   Hedgers
    *   Institutional active managers
    *   Asset allocators
    *   Informed traders (e.g., hedge funds, principal trading firms)
    *   Retail investors
*   Excess returns come from five major sources:
    1.  Pure arbitrage
    2.  Risk
    3.  Liquidity
    4.  Flow predictability
    5.  Funding constraints
    6.  Informational advantages
*   Predictable flows
    Informational advantage in predicting future returns
*   Quantitative investing employs analytical models that can be partitioned into three broad groups:
    *   Risk measurement models and data
    *   Market impact models
    *   Expected return models and data
*   The investment process has several stages:
    *   Data collection: Prices, trading volumes, asset characteristics, time series data, and unstructured data
    *   Pre-trade analysis: Risk assessment, expected return estimation, and transaction cost analysis
    *   Portfolio construction: Aggregation of signals, incorporation of risk constraints, and hedging
    *   Post-trade evaluation: Performance attribution and risk adjustments based on intertemporal volatility and leverage considerations.

**Notes** (Right Sidebar from Page 56)

[1] Cf. to Harris (2003).
[2] Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) is a measure of the interest rate charged for overnight cash loans.
[3] GPs in hedge funds are both principals (since they invest their own money) and agents (on behalf of the LPs). To resolve this conflict of interest, the SEC regulates the class of investors who can be LPs (high-net-worth individuals), and gives LPs special privileges within the fund.
[4] This is not always true in practice because (a) some hedge funds have an explicit market exposure and (b) some hedge funds have an asymmetric exposure to the market (Agarwal and Naik, 2004).
[5] The “market” here denotes a set of common risk factors. For a long time most of good quality accounting for corporate actions, is hard, expensive, and requires skill.
[6] COST OF OBTAINING FINANCIAL INFORMATION UNDER TITLE V OF THE GRAMM-LEACH-BLILEY ACT OF 1999 (GLBA) IS 15 U.S.C. § 6802 (a).
[7] As in the case of the past GameStop, we can represent portfolios as synthetic assets.
[8] Note that this is not the same as front-running. The latter also consists of buying or selling a security based on a demand forecast of said security. But in the latter case, the forecast relies on non-public information.
